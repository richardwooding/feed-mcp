**Bring RSS feeds to Claude Desktop** ‚Äî Read news, blogs, and updates directly in your AI conversations.

## What is feed-mcp?

feed-mcp is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets Claude Desktop read RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. Think of it as a bridge that connects your favorite websites' RSS feeds to Claude, so you can ask questions about the latest articles, get summaries, and stay updated‚Äîall from within your Claude chat.

### Why use it?

- üì∞ **Stay informed** ‚Äî Read the latest news and blog posts without leaving Claude
- üéØ **Get summaries** ‚Äî Ask Claude to summarize multiple articles across different feeds
- üîç **Deep dive** ‚Äî Research topics by querying specific feeds or articles
- ‚ö° **Save time** ‚Äî No need to open multiple websites to stay current

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add to Claude Desktop

Open your Claude Desktop configuration file and add feed-mcp with your favorite feeds:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run",
        "https://techcrunch.com/feed/",
        "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

Restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

### Step 3: Start chatting!

Try asking Claude:
- "What are the latest tech news headlines?"
- "Summarize the top 5 articles from my feeds"
- "Are there any articles about AI today?"

## Using Your RSS Reader Feeds

Already have feeds in Feedly, Inoreader, or another RSS reader? Export them as OPML and use with feed-mcp:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-feeds": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-v", "/path/to/your/feeds.opml:/feeds.opml:ro",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run", "--opml", "/feeds.opml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**How to export OPML:**
- **Feedly**: Settings ‚Üí OPML ‚Üí Export
- **Inoreader**: Preferences ‚Üí Folders and Tags ‚Üí Export OPML
- **NewsBlur**: Account ‚Üí Import/Export ‚Üí Export Stories
- **The Old Reader**: Settings ‚Üí Import/Export ‚Üí Export

## How Claude Reads Feeds

When you ask Claude about your feeds, here's what happens:

1. **Browse first** ‚Äî Claude gets a list of article titles and metadata
2. **Read selectively** ‚Äî Claude only fetches full content for articles you ask about
3. **Smart caching** ‚Äî Articles are cached to avoid re-fetching

This two-pass approach keeps responses fast and prevents overwhelming your conversation.

### Example Usage

**You**: "What's new in tech today?"

Claude will:
1. Browse your tech feed titles
2. Summarize the latest headlines
3. Ask if you want details on specific articles

**You**: "Tell me more about the first article"

Claude will:
1. Fetch the full content of that article
2. Provide a detailed summary or answer your questions

## Features

- üåê **Multiple formats** ‚Äî RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds
- üì± **Import from readers** ‚Äî OPML support for easy migration
- üíæ **Smart caching** ‚Äî Efficient feed retrieval with automatic updates
- ‚ö° **Fast & reliable** ‚Äî Built-in rate limiting and error handling
- üîí **Secure** ‚Äî URL validation and private IP blocking
- üê≥ **Easy deployment** ‚Äî Docker and Podman support

- **Dynamic feed management** ‚Äî Add/remove feeds at runtime
- **MCP Resources** ‚Äî Advanced filtering and real-time subscriptions

See [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md) for details.

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Go Install

If you have Go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/richardwooding/feed-mcp@latest
feed-mcp run https://techcrunch.com/feed/
```

Then configure Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-mcp": {
      "command": "feed-mcp",
      "args": ["run", "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Podman

Prefer Podman over Docker? Just replace `docker` with `podman`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-mcp": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run",
        "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude hit the maximum length for this conversation"

If you see this error:
- You're fetching too many large articles at once
- Try asking Claude to browse titles first, then read specific articles
- The server automatically limits content to prevent this

### Feed not updating

Feeds are cached for 10 minutes by default. If you need fresh data:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Restart Claude Desktop to clear the cache

### Private/localhost feeds

By default, localhost and private IP feeds are blocked for security. To enable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run", "--allow-private-ips",
        "http://localhost:8080/feed.xml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
