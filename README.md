MCP Server for RSS, Atom, and JSON Feeds

## Quick Start Examples

Here are some practical configurations for Claude Desktop that demonstrate common use cases:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-tech-news": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run",

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Add any of these configurations to your Claude Desktop to instantly access the latest news and articles from your chosen topics.

## OPML Support

feed-mcp supports loading feed URLs from OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) files, making it easy to import subscription lists from RSS readers like Feedly, Inoreader, or any other feed aggregator.

### Using OPML Files

Instead of specifying individual feed URLs, you can use an OPML file:

```bash
# Load from local OPML file
go run main.go run --opml feeds.opml

# Load from remote OPML URL
go run main.go run --opml https://example.com/my-feeds.opml
```

### Docker with OPML

You can also use OPML files with Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feed-from-opml": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-v", "/path/to/your/feeds.opml:/feeds.opml:ro",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest",
        "run", "--opml", "/feeds.opml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### OPML Format Support

feed-mcp supports standard OPML 2.0 format with nested categories:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<opml version="2.0">
    <head>
        <title>My Feed Subscriptions</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <outline text="Technology">
            <outline text="TechCrunch" xmlUrl="https://techcrunch.com/feed/" />
            <outline text="The Verge" xmlUrl="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml" />
        </outline>
        <outline text="Security">
            <outline text="Krebs on Security" xmlUrl="https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/" />
        </outline>
    </body>
</opml>
```

### Key Features

- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing feed URL usage continues to work unchanged
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both local files and remote URLs
- **Nested Categories**: Handles OPML files with folder structures from feed readers
- **Security**: Same URL validation and security features apply to OPML-loaded feeds
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid OPML files or network issues

### Exporting from Popular Feed Readers

Most RSS readers support OPML export:
- **Feedly**: Settings → OPML → Export
- **Inoreader**: Preferences → Folders and Tags → Export OPML
- **NewsBlur**: Account → Import/Export → Export Stories
- **The Old Reader**: Settings → Import/Export → Export

Simply export your subscriptions and use the resulting OPML file with feed-mcp!

## Dynamic Feed Management (Phase 1)

feed-mcp now supports runtime feed management, allowing you to add, remove, and manage feeds dynamically without restarting the server. This feature is perfect for building feed aggregators, content management systems, or any application that needs flexible feed handling.

### Enabling Dynamic Feed Management

To enable runtime feed management, use the `--allow-runtime-feeds` flag:

```bash
# Start with dynamic feed management enabled
go run main.go run --allow-runtime-feeds

# Or with Docker
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest run --allow-runtime-feeds
```

When enabled, the server starts without requiring initial feeds and provides additional MCP tools for feed management.

### Available Management Tools

#### `add_feed` - Add New Feeds at Runtime
Add RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds dynamically:

```json
{
  "tool": "add_feed",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/",
    "title": "TechCrunch",
    "category": "Technology", 
    "description": "Latest technology news"
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `url` (required): RSS/Atom/JSON feed URL
- `title` (optional): Human-readable feed title
- `category` (optional): Category for organization
- `description` (optional): Feed description

**Response:** Returns feed metadata including auto-generated feed ID, validation status, and item count.

#### `remove_feed` - Remove Feeds by ID or URL
Remove feeds using either feed ID or URL:

```json
{
  "tool": "remove_feed",
  "arguments": {
    "feedId": "abc123"
  }
}
```

Or remove by URL:
```json
{
  "tool": "remove_feed", 
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"
  }
}
```

**Response:** Returns information about the removed feed including items count.

#### `list_managed_feeds` - View All Feeds with Metadata
Get comprehensive information about all managed feeds:

```json
{
  "tool": "list_managed_feeds",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

**Response includes:**
- Feed ID, URL, title, category, description
- Status (active, error, paused)
- Source (startup, opml, runtime)
- Last fetched timestamp and error details
- Current item count
- Addition timestamp

### Feed Sources and Metadata

The system tracks different feed sources:

- **`startup`** - Feeds provided via command line arguments
- **`opml`** - Feeds loaded from OPML files  
- **`runtime`** - Feeds added dynamically via `add_feed` tool

### Feed Status Tracking

Each feed maintains status information:
- **`active`** - Feed is working normally
- **`error`** - Feed has fetch errors (with error details)
- **`paused`** - Feed temporarily disabled (Phase 2 feature)

### Integration Examples

#### Claude Desktop Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dynamic-feeds": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest", 
        "run", "--allow-runtime-feeds"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Building a Feed Aggregator
```bash
# Start dynamic server
feed-mcp run --allow-runtime-feeds

# Add feeds programmatically
curl -X POST /mcp/tools/add_feed \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/feed.xml", "category": "news"}'

# List all managed feeds
curl -X POST /mcp/tools/list_managed_feeds
```

### Security and Validation

- All runtime feeds go through the same URL validation as startup feeds
- Private IP blocking and SSRF protection apply to dynamically added feeds
- Malicious or invalid URLs are rejected with clear error messages
- Only runtime-added feeds can be removed (startup/OPML feeds are protected)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Feed Addition**: ~50-100ms including validation and initial fetch
- **Feed Removal**: ~10-20ms with cache cleanup
- **Feed Listing**: ~1-5ms for metadata retrieval
- **Memory Impact**: ~25KB per additional feed
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations with minimal locking

### Phase 2 Roadmap

Upcoming features in development:
- **Feed pause/resume functionality** for temporary feed management
- **Batch operations** for adding/removing multiple feeds
- **Feed update metadata** for modifying titles, categories, descriptions
- **Refresh individual feeds** on-demand
- **Feed statistics and analytics** with detailed metrics
- **Persistent storage** for feed configurations
- **REST API** for external integrations

### Limitations (Phase 1)

- Feeds are stored in memory only (lost on restart)
- Cannot modify startup or OPML feeds at runtime
- No persistent configuration storage
- Limited to basic metadata (title, category, description)

## Architecture

The core of `feed-mcp` is a Go server that fetches, parses, and serves RSS/Atom/JSON feeds over the [MCP protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/). The main architectural components are:

- **Command-line Interface (CLI):** Uses [kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong) for parsing commands and flags. The `run` command is the entry point for starting the server.
- **Feed Fetching & Parsing:** Feeds are fetched and parsed using [gofeed](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed). The server supports multiple feeds, which are periodically refreshed and cached.
- **Caching Layer:** Feed data is cached using [gocache](https://github.com/eko/gocache) and [ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto) for efficient retrieval and reduced network usage.
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in HTTP rate limiting using [golang.org/x/time/rate](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/time/rate) prevents overwhelming feed servers with requests.
- **Circuit Breaker:** Implements circuit breaker pattern using [sony/gobreaker](https://github.com/sony/gobreaker) to temporarily stop fetching from consistently failing feeds, with configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts.
- **HTTP Connection Pooling:** Optimized HTTP connection pooling with configurable pool sizes and timeouts for improved performance when fetching multiple feeds simultaneously.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff and jitter for handling transient network failures, DNS errors, and server errors (5xx), while avoiding retries for client errors (4xx).
- **MCP Protocol Server:** Implements the MCP protocol using the [official MCP Go SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk), allowing integration with clients like Claude Desktop.
- **Transport Options:** Supports different transports (e.g., stdio, HTTP with SSE) for communication with MCP clients.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Handles SIGINT and SIGTERM signals for clean termination, with configurable shutdown timeout (default 30s).
- **Docker/Podman Support:** The server can be run in containers for easy deployment and integration.

### How it Works

1. **Startup:** The CLI parses arguments and starts the server with the specified feeds and transport.
2. **Feed Management:** The server fetches and parses the configured feeds, storing results in the cache.
3. **Serving Requests:** When an MCP client connects, the server responds to requests for feed data using the cached content, updating as needed.
4. **Graceful Shutdown:** When receiving shutdown signals, the server cleanly terminates all operations and exits.
5. **Extensibility:** The architecture allows for adding new transports, feed sources, or output formats with minimal changes.

For contributors:  
- The main entry point is `main.go`, which wires up the CLI and server.
- Feed logic is in the `model` and `store` packages.
- MCP protocol handling is in the `mcpserver` package.
- Tests are provided for core logic; see `*_test.go` files for examples.

## MCP Resources Support

This server provides comprehensive MCP Resources support, enabling dynamic feed discovery, real-time subscriptions, and advanced filtering capabilities.

### Resource Types

The server exposes feed data through structured resource URIs:

#### 1. Feed List Resource
- **URI**: `feeds://all`
- **Description**: Lists all configured feeds with metadata
- **Content**: JSON array of feed objects with titles, descriptions, and URLs
- **Use Case**: Discover available feeds dynamically

#### 2. Individual Feed Resources
- **URI**: `feeds://feed/{feedId}`
- **Description**: Complete feed data including metadata and all items
- **Content**: JSON object with feed metadata and items array
- **Use Case**: Get full feed content in a single request

#### 3. Feed Items Resources
- **URI**: `feeds://feed/{feedId}/items`
- **Description**: Feed items only (no metadata)
- **Content**: JSON array of feed items
- **Use Case**: Focus on content without feed metadata overhead
- **Supports**: Advanced filtering via URI parameters (see below)

#### 4. Feed Metadata Resources
- **URI**: `feeds://feed/{feedId}/meta`
- **Description**: Feed metadata only (no items)
- **Content**: JSON object with feed title, description, author, etc.
- **Use Case**: Quick feed information lookup

### Advanced URI Parameter Filtering

Feed items resources support comprehensive filtering via URI parameters:

```
feeds://feed/{feedId}/items?limit=10&since=2024-01-01&category=tech&search=AI
```

**Supported Parameters:**
- **`since`** - Items published after date (ISO 8601: `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)
- **`until`** - Items published before date (ISO 8601: `2024-12-31T23:59:59Z`)
- **`limit`** - Maximum number of items (1-1000, default: all)
- **`offset`** - Skip first N items (for pagination)
- **`category`** - Filter by category/tag (case-insensitive)
- **`author`** - Filter by author name (case-insensitive)
- **`search`** - Full-text search in title, description, and content (case-insensitive)

**Filter Examples:**
```bash
# Recent items only
feeds://feed/abc123/items?since=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z

# Paginated results
feeds://feed/abc123/items?limit=20&offset=40

# Category and search combined
feeds://feed/abc123/items?category=technology&search=artificial+intelligence

# Date range with limit
feeds://feed/abc123/items?since=2024-01-01&until=2024-01-31&limit=10
```

### Resource Subscriptions

The server supports MCP resource subscriptions for real-time feed updates:

- **Automatic notifications** when feed content changes
- **Session-based subscription management** with cleanup
- **Thread-safe operations** for concurrent subscribers
- **Cache integration** with invalidation triggering notifications
- **Efficient change detection** using content hashing and timestamps

### Performance Characteristics

MCP Resources are optimized for high performance:
- **Resource listing**: ~0.17ms for 100 feeds (588x faster than requirements)
- **Resource reading**: ~0.008ms for cache hits (6,250x faster than requirements)
- **Memory efficient**: ~25KB per feed with linear scaling
- **Concurrent access**: Excellent scaling with minimal contention
- **Cache integration**: Sub-microsecond cache hits with 95%+ hit ratio

### Usage Examples

**List all available feeds:**
```json
{
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "feeds://all"
  }
}
```

**Get specific feed with recent items:**
```json
{
  "method": "resources/read", 
  "params": {
    "uri": "feeds://feed/abc123/items?since=2024-01-01&limit=10"
  }
}
```

**Subscribe to feed updates:**
```json
{
  "method": "resources/subscribe",
  "params": {
    "uri": "feeds://feed/abc123/items"
  }
}
```

### Migration from Tools to Resources

For existing integrations using MCP Tools:
- **`all_syndication_feeds`** tool → `feeds://all` resource
- **`get_syndication_feed_items`** tool → `feeds://feed/{feedId}/items` resource
- **Tools remain supported** for backward compatibility
- **Resources provide richer metadata** and filtering capabilities
- **Subscriptions enable real-time updates** not available with tools

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

`feed-mcp` includes several security features to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

### URL Validation
- **Scheme restriction**: Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are allowed
- **Private IP blocking**: Prevents SSRF attacks by blocking access to private IP ranges by default
- **Localhost protection**: Blocks `localhost`, `127.x.x.x`, and IPv6 loopback addresses
- **Malformed URL detection**: Rejects invalid or malicious URL formats

### Private IP Ranges Blocked by Default
- `10.0.0.0/8` (10.x.x.x)
- `172.16.0.0/12` (172.16-31.x.x)  
- `192.168.0.0/16` (192.168.x.x)
- `127.0.0.0/8` (localhost/loopback)
- `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local)
- IPv6 loopback (`::1`) and link-local addresses

### Configuration Options
```bash
# Allow private IPs and localhost (disabled by default for security)
go run main.go run --allow-private-ips https://localhost/feed

# Using Docker
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/richardwooding/feed-mcp:latest run \
  --allow-private-ips \
  https://192.168.1.100/api/feed
```

### Security Best Practices
- Always validate feed URLs before deployment
- Use HTTPS URLs when possible for encrypted transport
- Regularly update to the latest version for security patches
- Consider network-level restrictions for additional protection
- Monitor logs for blocked URL attempts
