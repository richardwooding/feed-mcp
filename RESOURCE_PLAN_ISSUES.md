## Implementation Order

1. **Issue 1**: Core Resource Infrastructure (Foundation)
2. **Issue 2**: Feed-to-Resource Mapping (Core functionality)
3. **Issue 4**: Resource Caching Integration (Performance)
4. **Issue 6**: Error Handling and Validation (Robustness)
5. **Issue 3**: Resource Subscription Management (Advanced features)
6. **Issue 5**: URI Parameter Filtering (Enhancement)
7. **Issue 7**: Performance Optimization (Polish)
8. **Issue 8**: Documentation and Examples (Completion)

## Success Criteria Summary

Each issue must meet the following overall requirements:
- All tests pass (unit and integration)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code coverage maintained above 90%
- **golangci-lint passes with zero violations (mandatory for each issue)**
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- Documentation updated appropriately
- Changes reviewed and approved via PR process

## Technical Decisions

- **Hash Function**: FNV (Fowler-Noll-Vo) non-cryptographic hash is used for feed ID generation instead of cryptographic hashes for better performance, as cryptographic security is not required for this use case.
